Whenever you add a number i, it's like you have a series of options:
num of left, num of right
0, i - 1
1, i - 1 - 1
2, i - 2 - 2
...
i - 1, 0

You can get this from the dp array. And you should time them and them some the products.

The dp should start with 0 node(s), which have only 1 possibility, i.e. empty child.
