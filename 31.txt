Next Permutation

1 5 8 4 7 6 5 3 1
4 is the first letter from the right small than its right, i.e. 4 < 7

1 5 8 5 7 6 4 3 1
Switch 4 with the one just large than it to his right, i.e. swap 4, 5

1 5 8 5 1 3 4 6 7
Reverse the the sublist to the right of 5.

The key to solve the problem is to figure out how to get the next permutation by observation from an example. Here 1 5 8 4 7 6 5 3 1 is a good example.
